Create a flask application to manage the AWS IAM users. It should have the below features:
    1. List users in the AWS Account
    2. Get the specific user details including users age, secret credentials age, etc
    3. Generate the report for the users details
    4. List the users IAM policies which are attached to them. It can include either group policies, directly attached policies, or inline policies.
    5. It should filter the policies based on the services it is using. For eg: ec2 related policies, ssm related policies, etc.
    6. Delete a specific user
    7. Generate the list of user whose password or access keys are older than x no of days.
    8. List all the users who doesnt have MFA enabled.
    9. List all the users who have Administrator policy attached to them
